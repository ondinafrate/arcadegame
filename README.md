# Classic Arcade Game 

## Instructions

The player's goal is to get to the top without getting ran down by the enemies, the ladybugs. Use the left, right, up and down arrows to move across the platform.

In order to run the game on your computer, download this repo. After you downloaded the repo, open index.html in your browser and play the game.

Additionally if you want to run the game locally on your computer, on your terminal check if you have Python installed and which version (most Mac computers have that). Change directory (cd) into the game folder that you just downloaded. After you cd-ed into the folder, in case you have Python 2 run this server: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 and if you have Python 3 run this: python3 -m http.server 8000. It will open your localhost 8000 where you can view and play the game.
